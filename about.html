<body><h1>About Star Arts</h1>
    
    <p>Star Arts is a small group from Wollongong and they want to share their art with the community. They also want to inspire and show children that they can make art and have small companies too.</p>
    <p>They want to be known as something that inspires other people to make art with their friends and family. "Drawing is a healthy activity!" Quote by Anonymous. Star Arts has an Astronomy Divison for pictures of things off this planet (literaly), a Technology Divison to show other people how to draw stuff that Star Arts like to draw and an Art Divison to display art.</p>
